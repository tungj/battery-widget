<h2>Date Clock Widget privacy policy</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the Date Clock Widget app.
    This is a simple utility for showing the current time and date in a configurable font size as a
    resizable Android widget. It does not contain any ads or user-generated content, it just tells the time.
</p>

<p>Since it's just a clock, it doesn't collect any personally identifiable information.
    Google Play may collect aggregate statistics about the app, e.g. number of times installed etc,
    but that's standard behaviour for every app on the Play Store.</p>
<p>

<h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
This widget does not collect any personally identifying information about the user.
It's purely local (doesn't call to external servers) and only runs on your device.
</p>

<p>
<h3>How do we use this information?</h3>
We don't really have information to use, apart from summary statistics given to us from Google Play.
Google Play may collect some aggregate statistics, e.g. number of installs/uninstalls/crashes
etc. but we don't plan to distribute this information.
</p>

<p>
<h3>What information do we share?</h3>
There isn't any personally identifying information to share, so we're not planning on sharing any
information.
